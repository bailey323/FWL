              <h3>Lara Bailey</h3>
              <h5>About Me</h5>
              <p>
                Hi, my name is Lara and I have been teaching fitness classes for over 10 years at various sites in the Leicestershire area. I currently teach a variety of different group exercise classes, both online and in person. I am also a qualified Level 3 Personal Trainer and am training towards becoming a pre & postnatel fitness specialist.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe in providing workouts that will push you and help you achieve your goals but in a fun and welcoming environment. This means I believe in what I am teaching and I have seen results in myself from these programmes so want to bring this to my participants.

            <h3>Group Exercise</h3>
            <p>
                I started my group fitness career aged 18 where I qualified in Exercise to Music, giving me the oportunity to create my own choreography as well as teach my own fitness classes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been lucky enough to have been selected for the Les Mills presenter bootcamp twice, as well as been made a Les Mills Tribe Coach, and shadow on stage with the Programme director for SH'BAM in front or hundereds of instructors and participants at Alexandra Palace, London and in New Zealand. I have also represented Nuffield Health Leicester at the Gay Pride event in Leicester with collegues and participants from the club.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love my job and love being able to help people achieve their goals, hear their fitness journeys and help create a fitter and happier place for people to thrive in.

            <h3>Pre & Postnatal Fitness</h3>
            <p>
                In 2019 I had my beautiful daughter Luna, I exercised throughout my pregnancy and have learnt a lot about my body during and after birth. I had a caesarean delivery so I am also familiar with recovery after this along with the changes in your body post partum.
            </p>
            <p>
                Having Luna spurred me on to finally train to be a pre and postnatal fitness specialist, so I can help mums and mums to be to have a healthy pregnancy and regain their fitness (and some “me time”) after birth. I will soon be adding extra pre and postnatal PT and group exercise sessions to my timetable.

            <h3>Dancing</h3>
            <p>
                I started dancing age 3 and continued to take part in dance classes, with a gap where I switched and took gymnastics classes for a couple of years, until the age of 15. I achieved grades 1-3 in ballet and grades 1-5 in tap as well as my completing gymnastics grades 5-1 too.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have always had a love of dance and movement with music and love trying out new dances as well as challenging myself by creating choreography for my DANCE&TONE classes.

            <h3>Tae Kwon Do</h3>
            <p>
                I started Tae Kwon Do age 13 and continued this until I was 22 where I could no longer attend classes due to my fitness classes taking over.
            </p>
            <p>
                During this time I achieved my 2nd degree Black Belt, became British champion in Patterns as well as placing in top 3 in other regional competions in patterns and team patterns. I have also umpired many large competitions around the United Kingdom.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is where my love of martial arts started and has helped me with my flexibility and technique for my BODYCOMBAT classes.
